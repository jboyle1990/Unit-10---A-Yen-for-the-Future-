# Unit-10---A-Yen-for-the-Future-
HW for Unit 10


## Introduction

This assignment was to use various sets of time series models to analyze Yen data from 1979 to 2019. We cleaned the data and filtered to build a dataframe of information from 1990 to 2019. We then analyzed our data to determine the following:

1. If we should invest in the Yen 
2. How do our models perform?

We used various different models to answer thse questions that can be found in two separate notebooks. These processes are outlined below.

## Notebook 1 - Time Series Forecasting

1. Decomposition using a Hodrick - Prescott Filter
2. Forecasting Returns using a ARMA Model
3. Forecasting the Settle Price with an ARIMA Model
4. Forecasting Volatility with Garch



## Notebook 2 - Linear Regression Forecasting

1. Using a Linear Regression Model
2. Using the testing data
3. analyzing in sample performance
4. analyzing out of sample performance


## Conclusions
